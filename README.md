# Me learning neural networks

Hello this is very bad neural network to detect a dog or a cat. 

If you want to run through the training part yourselft with the images and everything get the dataset from <a href = "https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=54765">microsoft petImages</a>.
Else you can also just use the .pickle files where i have stored the compressed dataset which is already shuffled.
# Is it good?
No it isn't but it did give me a better understanding of how neural networks work.
Here you can the the graph of the cost and if i must say so myself it does look pretty nice.

But then the thing everybody want to know the accuracy. After optimizing the learning rate and the iterations to a whopping <br>
120 000(yes the graph isn't the right one) i got a trian accuracy of about 80% and a test accuracy of about the same.

This is because i didn't have a good test dataset so i had to use the original one so basicaly it is kindeof bad...

Well hope this could help you in a way.
